# Epidemic Modeling {#modeling}

## An Introduction to Epidemic Modeling

Daniel Bernoulli is credited with developing the first disease transmission model. [@dietz2002daniel]. Bernoulli developed an epidemiological model in 1760 and used it to demonstrate the life expectancy increased due to the use of inoculation against smallpox. When William Farr noticed the similarity between the time series of smallpox incidence and the normal distribution, he have been the first to try to calibrate (or fit) a model of disease transmission. In 1889, En’ko investigated heterogeneity in measles transmission, using models to explain the possible mechanisms that give rise to variable epidemic sizes; see @en1989course. Kermack and McKendrick used differential equations to build the foundation of the modern susceptible-infected-recovered mass-action model in 1927, expanding on existing models; see @kermack1927contribution. These and other models have served as the foundation for modern disease modeling, which has proven to be an invaluable tool in advancing our understanding of best practices for infectious disease control. Infectious disease models enable the evaluation of public health interventions such as vaccines, projection of future disease burden in various contexts, and answering fundamental questions such as why some people are uninfected during an outbreak by combining mathematical or statistical formalism with epidemiological data and an understanding of biological mechanisms.

In epidemic modeling, there are mainly three types of models, including (i) mechanistic models, (ii) phenomenological models, and (iii) hybrid models. In the following, we will give a brief introduction to each type of models. More indepth studies will be covered in Chapters \@ref(compartment)--\@ref(ensemble).

## Mechanistic Models

Mechanistic models explicitly try to model the mechanisms of interaction among system components. The biological mechanisms that drive infection dynamics are hypothesized explicitly in these models.

### Compartment Modeling

A compartment model is characterized by a set of mathematical equations to represent how individuals move from one compartment to another or interact among compartments. A majority of the compartment models in epidemiology are based on the Susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model @kermack1927contribution and its variants to conceptualize the dynamic changes of the population. 

The traditional SIR model divides a population into three compartments: the susceptible class (S), the infected class (I), and the removeds (R). The susceptible class (S) represents those who are susceptible to infection, the infected class (I) represents those who are infectious, and the removed class (R) represents those who have permanent infection-acquired immunity. The SIR model has become popular and has been widely used to track and forecast the trajectory of epidemic disease due to its simplicity with a small number of parameters. For example, @miranda2019real calibrated the parameters of the SIR model for each season separately using the Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm to predict weekly influenza-like-illness (ILI) incidence. @chen2021model considered the SIR model for Canadian COVID-19 data. The estimates and bounds of model parameters were extracted by minimizing the squared prediction error of daily infection numbers. Based on those values, the prediction bounds for S, I, R, and daily infection numbers can be obtained. However, the SIR model often oversimplifies complex processes of disease. 

For many epidemic diseases, if an exposed period (infected but not yet infectious) is long enough or significant, its absence in the model could affect predictions @brauer2008compartmental. The SEIR model additionally includes an exposed (E) compartment for the latent period. The SEIR has been applied to malaria transmission by formulating a system of equations for both human and mosquito population @mojeeb2017simple and Ebola hemorrhagic fever by considering vaccination as a control strategy [@durojaye2017mathematical]. @roda2020difficult considered both SIR and SEIR models and  predicted the COVID-19 epidemic. Although a Poisson or negative binomial distribution is a common choice for count data, its probability model was approximated by normal distribution as newly confirmed cases grow quickly. The affine invariant ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was implemented for posterior distributions of model parameters using uniform priors for model parameters to reduce the impact of nonidentifiability in the model.

In Chapter \@ref(compartment), we will study compartment models with more detailed structure and see how they can help study infectious diseases.


### Agent-based Methods
 
Individual-based models, or agent-based models, are a powerful simulation modeling technique that uses interacting autonomous agents. Agents are artificial decision-making entities and programmed to interact with other agents and the environment in specific ways. In the epidemic modeling, agents could stay either at the state of susceptibility, the state of infected, or any pre-defined states. Then, these agents interact with each other based on a specific environment, which is usually defined through a social contact network. Agents can transfer from a state to another. A typical agent-based model consists of three key elements: (1) a population based on the studied population's demographic characteristics, (2) a social contact network among the population's agents (individuals), and (3) a disease model that translates the edge weights in the social contact network into infection probability [@hoertel2020stochastic]. By simulating a set of simple agents' interactions, they can generate complex global patterns (behaviors) and visualize main properties from a global perspective. 

A good example of using this approach for COVID-19 is by a team from Imperial College London @krr2020non who applied an agent-based modeling approach to the UK data. The authors predicted the spread of COVID-19 after including many Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions. To predict the number of COVID-19 cases in France, @hoertel2020stochastic uses a stochastic agent-based model of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. A group of researchers from various universities proposed the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model ([GLEAM](https://covid19.gleamproject.org/) to analyze the spatiotemporal spread of COVID-19 in the continental United States using an agent-based model.

Agent-based models use more detailed descriptions of disease states and/or individual characteristics and behavior, which are not easily simplified into a compartmental form. It allows for exploring complex systems and capturing relationships among individuals and heterogeneity in their attributes [@rahmandad2008heterogeneity]. Besides, it can model experiments that may be impossible or unethical to conduct in the real world, guiding public health interventions.

Agent-based models require intensive computational burdens, constraining sensitivity analysis. Because data on contact networks and the distribution of individual attributes is difficult to come by and highly uncertain, extensive sensitivity analysis is required to ensure reliable results.

## Phenomenological Models

Phenomenological models, sometimes also referred to as statistical models, attempt to characterize and forecast the observed effects of epidemics without incorporating biological mechanisms and postulating conjectures that explain the observed phenomena.

### Time Series Analysis

In time series analysis, we focus on using the past observations of a random variable to captures the underlying patterns and predict the future values. The two most widely used approaches in time series forecasting are *exponential smoothing* and *autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models*. Exponential smoothing models are used to describe the trend and seasonality of time series data, whereas ARIMA models are used to describe the autocorrelations. Below, we will give a short introduction to ETS and ARIMA models. Chapter \@ref(timeseries) will introduce the details of time series analysis and how to make the epidemic prediction using R. 

#### Exponential Smoothing (ETS)

Exponential smoothing was proposed by @Brown:59, @Holt:57, and @Winters:60 in the late 1950s. Traditional moving average methods use equal weights for previous observations, whereas exponential smoothing uses exponential functions to assign exponentially decreasing weights as the observations get older. Therefore, the forecasts produced by exponential smoothing methods can be considered as weighted averages of past observations. 

Since the simple exponential smoothing framework usually can generate reliable forecasts quickly, the simple ETS method is suitable for forecasting data with no clear trend or seasonal pattern.
    
* **Holt's Linear Trend Method**: @Holt:57 proposed a linear trend method based on simple exponential smoothing to allow data with a trend to be forecasted. This method involves three equations, including (i) a forecast equation, (ii) a smoothing equation for the level, and (iii) a smoothing equation for the trend. As a result, the $h$-step-ahead forecast equals the sum of the most recent estimated level and $h$ times the most recent estimated trend value, and the forecasts are linear to $h$. The long-term forecast is usually indefinitely increasing or decreasing due to the constant trend estimated by the Holt's linear.

* **Damped Trend Method**: Because constant trend has its limitations, @Gardner:Mckenzie:85 proposed a "damped" method, which includes a parameter that "dampens" the trend to a flat line in the future. As pointed out in @Hyndman:Athanasopoulos:2nd, the “damped” method is one of the most popular time-series methods for forecasting.

* **Holt-Winters' Seasonal Method**: @Holt:57 and @Winters:60 extended Holt's method to the Holt-Winters' Seasonal Method, which can analyze time series with seasonality, by taking into account a systematic trend or a seasonal component. The Holt-Winters seasonal method adds one more smoothing equation for the seasonal component to Holt's Linear Trend Method's three equations.

#### AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model 

The AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model  provides another approach to time series forecasting, and it combines the autoregression (AR) and moving average (MA) model. In an ARIMA model, linear correlations among the time-series are assumed, then the ARIMA model exploits these linear dependencies to extract local patterns and remove high-frequency noise from the data.

The ARIMA approach has three clear benefits. First of all, the interpretability level of the ARIMA model is very high. Therefore, researchers are able to gain a deep understanding of the relationship between the current and the past situations, and explore the influence of some exogenous variables. Secondly, the ARIMA model has an automated way to maximize prediction accuracy which can perform model selection efficiently. Thirdly, the ARIMA models have high accommodative ability due to the simplicity of model updates based on recent events. However, one drawback of the ARIMA models is that they cannot deal with nonlinear patterns or relationships.

### Regression methods

In epidemic modeling, regression methods are also popularly applied to estimate future prevalence or targets of interest. For example, @Altieri:etal:21 considered five regression models with different trends in COVID-19 death counts. In addition, the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has proposed a regression method called COVID-19 Forecasts using Fast Evaluations and Estimation (COFFEE); see @coffee2020. We will introduce (generalized) linear regression models and other regression models in Chapter \@ref(regression). We'll also show how regression and discrimination analysis can be used to quantify the effect of a set of explanatory variables on the spatial distribution of a specific outcome.


### Machine learning methods

With their great flexibility in capturing disease spread patterns, machine learning methods are appealing in the COVID-19 prediction. In the prediction of COVID-19, there are two major categories of machine learning methods. The first type of method uses epidemic models that are trained using machine learning algorithms. @zou2020epidemic proposes a variant of the SEIR model that accounts for COVID-19 cases that have not been tested or reported, and the model is estimated using a standard gradient-based optimizer. @arik2020interpretable integrates machine learning into compartmental disease modeling. It uses learning mechanisms, such as masked supervision from partial observations and partial teacher-forcing to minimize error propagation, to improve model estimation with limited training data. The second kind of method is based on conventional machine learning methods. @sujath2020machine applied linear regression, multilayer perceptron, and vector autoregression method for predicting COVID-19 cases in India gathered from the website of Kaggle. In @arora2020prediction, recurrent neural network (RNN) based long-short term memory (LSTM) is used to predict the number of COVID-19 reported cases for the state-level data in India. In Chapter \@ref(NN), we will provide some implementation details of neural network models for forecasting.


## Hybrid Models and Ensemble Methods

Because of a lack of understanding of the mechanistic details, hybrid modeling often refers to approaches where part of a model is formulated on the basis of mechanistic principles and part of the model has to be inferred from data. In the past two decades, statistical and machine learning-inspired time series methods have been successfully implemented in studying the spread dynamics of infectious diseases such as seasonal influenza. In COVID-19 studies, we have seen a growing number of hybrid methods combining characteristics of mechanistic models and phenomenological models. Examples of hybrid models and will be given Chapter \@ref(ensemble). Another hybrid method widely used in forecasting is the ensemble method, which combines multiple forecasting algorithms to improve predictive performance. The basic idea of ensemble methods is that when there is much uncertainty in finding the best model, combining different algorithms could improve prediction accuracy by reducing the instability of the forecast. We will also introduce some ensemble methods using multiple forecasting algorithms to improve the predictive performance in Chapter \@ref(ensemble).


## Epidemic Modeling: Mathematical and Statistical Perspectives

Epidemic modeling has three main aims [@Daley:Gani:01]: (1) to understand better the mechanisms by which diseases spread; (2) to identify which factors contribute to the spread of the epidemic, and therefore how we may control it; (3) to predict the future course of the epidemic. Although there are many epidemic modeling methods, mathematical and statistical models have played important roles in COVID-19studies. As illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:mathstat), mathematical and statistical approaches are complementary, but their starting points are different, and the corresponding models tend to incorporate different details.

```{r mathstat, out.width = "65%", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Mathematical and statistical perspectives on epidemic modeling."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/model.png")
```

As mentioned above, the fundamental concept of infectious disease epidemiology is investigating how the diseases spread. Mathematical models are undeniably useful in understanding infectious disease spread dynamics (e.g., when the peak will occur and whether resurgence will occur) and the effects of control measures [@Keeling:Rohani:08]. An essential type of mathematical model is the class of mechanistic models such as the  Susceptible - Infectious - Removed (SIR) compartmental model or the Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered model (SEIR) as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:SEIR); see details in @Brauer:etal:08 and @Lawson:etal:16. Mechanistic models express explicit hypotheses about the biological mechanisms that drive infection dynamics, and they work well when evaluating the efficacy of hypothetical NPIs in preventing disease spread [@lessler2016mechanistic]. 

```{r SEIR, out.width = "75%", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "An illustration of SIR and SEIR models."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/SEIR1.pdf")
```

In the literature, statistical modeling has given the scientific field many successes in analyzing data and getting information about the mechanisms producing the data. Statistical modeling is a powerful tool for extracting information about the disease spread in epidemic studies [@Held:etal:20]. Statistics starts with data, and statistical modeling allows data to speak for themselves. There are two cultures in statistical modeling [@Breiman:01]: the data modeling culture and the algorithmic modeling culture. The first assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model, which is typically designed for inference about variable relationships as well as prediction. Algorithmic models are designed to make the most accurate predictions possible by treating the data mechanism as unknown.

Other factors, such as demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and control policies, may also be responsible for temporal or spatial patterns in the spread of infectious diseases. The disease's spread, for example, varies greatly across different geographical regions. Local features, such as socioeconomic factors and demographic conditions, can have a significant impact on the epidemic's trajectory. These data are usually supplemented with the population information at the county level. Moreover, the capacity of the health care system, and control measures, such as government - mandated social distancing, also have a significant impact on the spread of the epidemic. Regression is a widely used statistical modeling method in epidemic studies because it produces a combination of the variables with weights indicating the impact of the variable [@jewell2003statistics]. It can help determine which factors matter most, which can be ignored, and how those factors interact with each other. The benefit of regression analysis is that it can be used to understand different patterns in data. These insights may often be very valuable in understanding which factors contribute to the spread of COVID-19.

Predicting the spread speed and severity of COVID-19 is crucial to resource management, developing strategies to deal with the epidemic, and ultimately assisting in prevention efforts. Mathematical models are able to mimic the way disease spreads and can be used to project or simulate future transmission scenarios under various assumptions. Statistical models are more oriented towards predictions [@Held:etal:20]. In fact, predictions are at the heart of statistical modeling. Time series analysis, for example, is a statistical forecasting technique that uses a series of historical observations to extrapolate patterns into the future. Machine learning makes predictions based on previously learned properties from training data. However, because they do not account for how transmission occurs, purely statistical models only describe the observed data and provide little information about the mechanism. Therefore, they are generally not well - suited for long - term predictions, and a few weeks is usually close to being the ultimate prediction limit. Another advantage of statistical modeling is its ability to quantify uncertainty in the prediction, especially at an early phase of an epidemic with limited data. For example, statistical models can provide a prediction interval to understand the uncertainty surrounding the forecast [@brockwell2002introduction]. 

In summary, mathematical models are usually constructed in a more principle - driven manner, while statistical models are more data driven. Although both mathematical and statistical models can be used to study the effect of NPIs and make predictions, the implementation details are different, and an understanding of the corresponding limitations is crucial. For maximal effectiveness, researchers working to advance epidemic modeling will need to appreciate and exploit the complementary strengths of mathematical and statistical models.


## Some Terminologies in Epidemic Modeling

In this section, we introduce some terminologies often used in infectious disease modeling.

* **Incidence:** number of new cases in a given time period expressed as a percentage of people infected per year (cumulative incidence) or number per person time of observation (incidence density).
    + Example: Meningococcal disease epidemics are common in Auckland, New Zealand, with annual incidences of up to 16.9 per 100,000 people.

* **Prevalence:** number of cases at a given time expressed as a percentage of the total number of cases at that time. 
    + Example: Obesity prevalence was 12.8 percent in a group of children aged 3 to 4 years old, according to a recent Scottish study.

* **Attack rate:** proportion of non-immune exposed individuals who become clinically ill.
    + An example: In an outbreak of gastroenteritis with 50 cases among a population at risk of 2500, the attack rate of disease is 50/2500 = 0.02.

* **Primary/secondary cases:** The primary case is a person who enters a population and infects it. Secondary cases are those who contract the infection afterward. “Waves” or “generations” are terms used to describe the spread of the virus.

* **Case fatality:** proportion of infected people who die as a result of the infection

* **Mortality:** proportion of the population who dies each year as a result of the disease, calculated as the product of incidence and case fatality rate.
   + Consider two populations as an example. There are 1,000 people in Population 1; 300 of them have the disease, and 100 of them die from it. The disease has a mortality rate of 100/1,000 or 10%. The fatality rate in this case is 100/300 = 33%. There are 1,000 people in Population 2, 50 of whom have the disease and 40 of whom have died as a result of it. The mortality rate is 40/1,000, or 4%; however, the case fatality rate is 40/50, or 80%.

* **Reproductive rate:** potential of an infectious disease spreading. Factors that have an impact include:
    + likelihood of infection spreading from an infected person to a susceptible person; 
    + contact frequency with the population;
    + duration of infection;
    + proportion of people who are immune.

* **Transmission routes:** direct (mucous membrane to mucous membrane, cross placental, blood or tissue, skin to skin, sneezes or coughs) and indirect (water, air borne, food borne, vectors or objects).

* **Reservoir:** the population of organisms or the specific environment in which an infectious pathogen naturally lives and reproduces, or upon which the pathogen primarily depends for its survival.

* **Incubation period:** time it takes for a disease to develop after being exposed to it (the time between inoculation and symptom expression).

* **Infectious period:** length of time a person can transmit disease.

* **Latent period:** period of infection without being infectious (the time between inoculation and infectiousness of the host). This may occur right after exposure or late in the disease.

* **Epidemic:** occurrence of cases of illness that lasts longer than expected. 
    +**Endemic** refers to an epidemic whose incidence has remained stable for a long time. 
    +**Pandemic** refers to a worldwide outbreak.
