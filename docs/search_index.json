For most sections, we only assume that readers are familiar with introductory statistics, and with high-school algebra. There are a couple of sections that also require knowledge of matrices, but these are flagged. At the end of each chapter we provide a list of “further reading.” In general, these lists comprise suggested textbooks that provide a more advanced or detailed treatment of the subject. Where there is no suitable textbook, we suggest journal articles that provide more information. We use R throughout the book and we intend students to learn how to forecast with R. R is free and available on almost every operating system. It is a wonderful tool for all statistical analysis, not just for forecasting. See the Using R appendix for instructions on installing and using R. Short Description: This book provides a quick start guide to infectious disease data analysis and visualization in R. You’ll learn, how to create static and interactive graphs. Long Description: This book will introduce readers to modern statistical models and state-of-the-art learning methods to analyze infectious disease data. Many of the key approaches, examples and case studies will be presented. The primary emphasis will be interpretation, inference and hands-on data analyses. This course also provides practical concepts and R computing skills to perform infectious disease data analysis and visualization. This book provides a quick start guide to infectious disease data analysis and visualization in R. You’ll learn, how to: Apply appropriate descriptive and inferential statistical techniques to infectious disease data and interpret results of statistical analyses in the context of public health research and evaluation; Develop skills in model building, investigating model assumptions, and interpreting results from statistical models with particular applications to epidemiologic and especially the infectious disease data; Develop the ability to use R to understand basic data structures, basic data processing skills, and basic data visualization skills; 1.1 Data Sets Used in Labs and Exercises In this textbook, we illustrate statistical learning methods for infectious disease data using applications from COVID-19 data. The slid package available on the book website contains a number of data sets that are required in order to perform the labs and exercises associated with this book. 1.2 Acknowledgements I am very appreciative of all the contributors to this immense open source project of R and R-Studio. I couldn’t have made this book without your contributions and the packages that you have developed. A special thanks go to Dr. Guannan Wang, Dr. Xinyi Li, Dr. Shan Yu, Miss Yueying Wang, Miss Zhiling Gu, Mr. Myungjin Kim for their help with the book. I would also like to thank Dr. Yihui Xie (Xie 2020) for his R Markdown package, which simplifies the writing of this book by having all content written in R Markdown. 1.3 About the Author Dr. Lily Wang is a tenured Professor of Statistics at Iowa State University. She received her Ph.D. in Statistics from Michigan State University in 2007. Prior to joining Iowa State in 2014, she was a tenure-track Assistant/tenured Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Georgia 2007-2013/2013-2014. Her primary areas of research include developing cutting-edge statistical non/semi-parametric methods, statistical learning of large datasets with complex features, methodologies for functional data, imaging data, and spatiotemporal data, survey sampling, and the application of statistics to problems in economics, engineering, neuroimaging, epidemiology, environmental studies, and biomedical science.
